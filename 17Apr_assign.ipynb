    "Gradient Boosting Regression or Gradient Boosting, is a powerful machine learning technique used for regression tasks. It's an ensemble learning method that combines the predictions of multiple weak learners (usually decision trees) to create a strong regression model. Gradient Boosting is known for its high predictive accuracy and ability to handle complex relationships between features and the target variable."

In each iteration, a weak learner is trained to minimize the loss function with respect to the residuals (errors) made by the current ensemble. This means the weak learner is \"guided\" by the gradient of the loss function to improve the predictions.\n",
